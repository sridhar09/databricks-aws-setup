#The Group Assignments YAML that needs to be passed as input is used to define the workspaces and which groups should be assigned.
#  Here's a sample YAML file.
#

#     group_config":
#      "workspace1":
#        - "admin"
#        - "trainer"
#        - "student"
#      "trainer_only_workspace":
#        - "admin"
#        - "trainer"
#
#  1. Each workspace has a list of groups which are assigned to that workspace
#  2. A single group can be assigned to more than 1 workspace
