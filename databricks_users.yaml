#  The User YAML that needs to be passed as input is used to define the NON ADMIN users & groups to be created.
#    Here's a sample YAML file.
#
#    ```yaml
#  "user_config":
#    "trainers":
#      - "user3@itv.com"
#      - "user4@itv.com"
#      - "user5@itv.com"
#    "students":
#      - "user6@itv.com"
#      - "user7@itv.com"
#    ```
#
#  1. Groups :
#    - All the keys inside `user_config` gets added as a group.
#    - The sample file above adds 3 Groups named `group1, group2 & group 3`
#  2. Users :
#    - Each group has a list of users which are assigned to that group
#    - Users will be automatically added to the account if not already exist.
#    - The sample file above adds 7 users named `user1@itv.com, user2@itv.com . . . user7@itv.com`
#    3. A single user can be part of more than 1 group
#  - For example `user3@itv.com & user4@itv.com` in the sample YAML are part of both admin & trainers
